    Remember that your goal is to review project 1 and think about how you can get it done. We will talk tomorrow more about the concepts there.
    
    Another note, someone brought a concern that the answer for 9.8 was incorrect in the grader. I've reviewed it and it looks good to me so we can discuss in class tomorrow if there are concerns on it. :)
