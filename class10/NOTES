    Hello Class,
    
    Exercises 16.2 and 17.2 were due today. In class, we discussed inheritance and wrote part of a poker program with classes.  We also started to talk about tests, but we did not complete that portion of class. We will be picking it up Thursday. There is 1 problem for homework tonight: 18.3. CF is extra credit if desired. Below is the resources from today's class as well as a repository where the answers we've gone over up until now are stored.
