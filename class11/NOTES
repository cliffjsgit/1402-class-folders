    Hello Class,
    
    Exercise 18.3 was due today. In class, we discussed better ways to write things we already learned and watched a video reinforcing those topics.  We also finished talking about tests. There is 1 problem for homework tonight: 19.1. CF is extra credit if desired. Below is the resources from today's class as well as a repository where the answers we've gone over up until now are stored.
