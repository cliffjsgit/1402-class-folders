    Hello Class,
    
    13.4 and 13.5 were due today. In class today, we discussed writing to files and databases. There is one problem for homework tonight: 14.3 and project 1 was due today as well. No need to worry about actually submitting 14.3. We also briefly went over Project 2. More information to come in a subsequent email, but feel free to take a look at the overview.
    
    Below are the resources from today's class.
