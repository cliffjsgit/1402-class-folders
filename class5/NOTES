    Hello Class,
    
    10.11 and 10.12 were due today. In class, we discussed dictionaries, their methods, and manipulation of them. There are two problems for homework tonight: 11.5 and 11.6. At the end of class we went over the concept of virtual environments as well as the steps given in the email to create them. At the end of class, we had time to work on either Project 1 or homework.
